## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Our team wants to solve the issue of college students overspending money. To solve this, we will create an Expense Report Database using a HashTable that your parents can manage. In our program, parents can set a limit to how much their child can spend each day. Once the child surpasses this set limit, the child will receieve a warning email saying that they cannot spend more for the day. 

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)

   Student Expense Tracker Database


2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include an example format of the output produced.
   There will be two outputs: If the student has overspent their allowance for the week, it will output how much/ where/ what the student is spending on along with a warning message stating that the student has overspent. Otherwise, if the student has NOT overspent, it will simply output the total amount spent for the week.
   
   Case 1 (student has overspent):
    "WARNING: STOP SPENDING! YOU HAVE SURPASSED THE WEEKLY SPENDING LIMIT OF $XXX. YOUR PARENTS WILL BE NOTIFIED."
    Detailed Report of Expenses:
    Item 1:<Name> Cost: $XX
    .
    .
   Case 2 (student has not overspent):
   "Great Job Managing your money. You have saved $XXX from your weekly allowance."
   Detailed Report of Expenses:
    Item 1:<Name> Cost: $XX
    .
    .

3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.



5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
